# üé® UI2Code Hackathon Submission

---

## üìå Project Overview

- **Goal**: Replicate the provided design as accurately as possible using HTML, CSS, and optionally frameworks like Bootstrap or JavaScript.
- **Tools Used**:  
  - HTML5  
  - CSS3  
  - Bootstrap 5 (for responsive Navbar)  
  - JavaScript (for animations)  
  - Custom CSS

---

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

- Navbar built using **Bootstrap** with brand logo, navigation links, and responsive toggle menu.
- Section-wise layout closely matches the given design.
- Fonts, colors, images, and spacing styled based on the design.
- Added **animations using vanilla JavaScript** for interactive elements.
- Carefully positioned images and elements to reflect design accuracy.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Changes / Assumptions Made

- Used Bootstrap only for Navbar; rest of the layout is custom.
- Substituted some design assets where original files weren‚Äôt provided.
- Implemented basic animations using JS (e.g., fade-ins, slide-ins).
- Some animations from the design were not implemented due to complexity or time constraints.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Animations (JS)

- Added custom animations to bring interactive feel to sections (e.g., entrance effects).
- Used basic scroll-triggered or load-time animations with JavaScript.
- Some advanced animations in the original design were not completed, especially those requiring libraries like GSAP or complex SVG motion.

---

## üß† Challenges Faced

- Balancing Bootstrap classes with custom styling was challenging.
- Some design animations were hard to recreate without additional libraries or time.
- Keeping pixel-perfect design while managing mobile layout proved difficult.

---

## ‚úÖ What Worked Well

- Successfully matched core layout and styling of the design.
- Navbar is fully responsive.
- JS animations added interactivity and enhanced the visual flow.
- Desktop layout closely resembles the original design.

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- Implement advanced animations using animation libraries (e.g., GSAP, Anime.js).
- Refactor and clean JS code for animation triggers.
- Make full site responsive using media queries and grid-based layout.
- Improve accessibility and semantic HTML structure.
